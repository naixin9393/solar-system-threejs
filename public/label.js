  SUN: ` Sun

  The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as light and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. It emits more energy in one second than Earth uses in an entire year.`,

  URANUS: `Uranus
  
  Distance from the Sun: Approximately 2.87 billion km.
  Diameter: 50,724 km.
  Orbit Period: 84 Earth years.
  Rotation Period: About 17.2 hours.
  Surface Temperature: Around -224°C, making it the coldest planetary atmosphere.
  Notable Feature: Uranus rotates on its side, with an axial tilt of about 98 degrees, resulting in extreme seasons.`,

  NEPTUNE: `Neptune

  Distance from the Sun: Approximately 4.5 billion km.
  Diameter: 49,244 km.
  Orbit Period: 165 Earth years.
  Rotation Period: About 16.1 hours.
  Surface Temperature: Approximately -214°C.
  Notable Feature: Neptune has strong winds and storms, with the fastest recorded wind speeds in the solar system reaching up to 2,100 km/h.`,

  PLUTO: `Pluto
  
  Distance from the Sun: Approximately 5.9 billion km at perihelion.
  Diameter: 2,377 km.
  Orbit Period: 248 Earth years.
  Rotation Period: About 6.4 Earth days.
  Surface Temperature: Ranges from -223°C to -233°C.
  Notable Feature: Pluto has a complex orbit that sometimes brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune.`,

  MOON: `Moon
  
  Distance from Earth: Approximately 384,400 km.
  Diameter: 3,474 km.
  Orbit Period: 27.3 Earth days.
  Rotation Period: About 27.3 Earth days.
  Surface Temperature: Ranges from -173°C to 127°C.
  Notable Feature: The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and has a significant influence on tides and the planet's rotation. It's thought to have formed from a giant impact with a Mars-sized body early in Earth's history.`,
